                    <p>Eventually I would like to build a website for the company. This website would include all of our services and pricing together with some examples of the previous work that we have done and this website would be accessible to all.  </p>
                    <p>Now let’s, from here on out, imagine that we are in the year 2021 and that this company is a reality. DigiArch will an audio portion to the website to allow people who have visual problems to hear and in addition to the visually impaired include anyone who would like an audio guide rather than a self guided tour.  </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, a holographic feature will be included as an additional aspect for those wanting to submerse themselves within the website. The website will house five main pages, with the first page featuring the ‘about us’ page. The ‘about us’ page will have an ‘about DigiArch’ section that is basically a place that highlights some of the different people that have used us. </p>
                    <p>Further, it will have an ‘about the founder’ section. The second page will be the services page and this page will list all of the services that we have to offer. 
                    <p> It will also house a section to show how different people are currently using our services in creative ways and this will hopefully spark the imagination of individuals into thinking about the different ways that our services can be utilized. </p>
                    <p>The third page will be a gallery page, this will house things that we will make out of the formats such as my word collages from Voyant, including images of different sites that we have worked on over the years.</p>
                    <p>The fourth page will be a contact page so that if anyone has any question about any part of our website they will be able to ask away! The fifth page will include a virtual ethics book. </p>
                    <p>This is because we want our clients to know that we are up-to-date regards proper ethics so they know that we will be able to provide the findings with ethical results. The last page includes our ‘wall of fame’ honouring all of our generous sponsorsp>
                    <p>The site will be riddled with different pictures of all of the work we have done in the hope of really wowing people!</p>

<p>I have created a timeline that houses what our company has done and what our company hopes to achieve in the future. It will also allow for incorporating crucial finds into the relevant field.</p>

<p>A Voyant clip will be added that will include all of the relevant articles that have been released so that guests can see what sort of things we are able to do with our company</p>

<p>Mapbox is a crucial part to the website. With the Mapbox tool the users scanning through our website can quickly search to find previous work that has been conducted all over the world to see the actual location of these projects — and if you are close by, you can even look at one of our finished projects!</p>

<p>Twine will be a useful addition to the website. Twine will enable users to scan through the different services that we offer at DigiArch. Users can simply click on a different service and it will take them to different processes to perform that task. From there, the user can go and look at the actual price of each task.</p>
